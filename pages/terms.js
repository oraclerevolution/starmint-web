            We call OpenSea&apos;s API/Binance&apos;s API for the potential display of NFT items created through Starmint. When an item or collection violates OpenSea&apos;s or Binance&apos;sTerms of Service, it will be delisted from being displayed on OpenSea or Binance. The item or collection will still exist on the blockchain but you won&apos;t be able to see it on OpenSea or Binance. This can happen if OpenSea or Binance determine the NFT to infringe on protected intellectual property, promote suicide or self-harm, incite hate or violence against others, degrade or dox another individual, otherwise violate OpenSea&apos;s/Binance&apos;s terms of service. Starmint will take down works in response to intellectual property infringement claims and will terminate a user&apos;s access to the Service if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.
